Allow users to register an account and thenadd a list of vehicles. From here users can then associate expenses to those vehicles. Features include the ability to edit and delete vehicles and delete expenses. 

Project was made with express on the backend and react on the frontend. Using jsonwebtokens for authentication and mongoDB to store data

Hosted on heroku, however I wasn't able to overcome the react router issues it causes. On certain features when a page refresh was called, namely deleting vehicles / expenses. I had to put in a complete site reload to overcome. The code in the project here does not include the final verisona uploaded to heroku, rather the version that runs as desired,  via localhost
